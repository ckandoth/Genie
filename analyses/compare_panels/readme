# GOAL: Ensure comparable gene names across panels, compare BED file loci, etc.

# First, gather the gene names used across institutes, from the files shared with the portal:
mkdir gene_lists
cp ../../data/cbioportal/{DFCI-ONCOPANEL-1,DFCI-ONCOPANEL-2,GRCC_CHP2,GRCC_CP1,GRCC_MOSC3,GRCC_SAFIR02,JHH-50GP-V1,MDA-46-V1,MDA-50-V1,MSK-IMPACT341,MSK-IMPACT410,NKI-TSACP,UHN-48-V1,VICC-01-D2,VICC-01-R2,VICC-01-T4b,VICC-01-T5a,VICC-01-T6b,VICC-01-T7}.txt gene_lists/

# Turn them all into FLAT files with 1 gene per line:
perl -i -pe 's/(\t|$)/\n/g; $_="" unless(m/^gene_list/); s/^gene_list:\s+//' gene_lists/*.txt

# Use data downloaded from genenames.org to HUGO-ify all the names:
# ::NOTE:: Given chrom names, use "bin/update_gene_names.pl" which can solve more ambiguities
ls gene_lists/*.txt | xargs -L1 -I% perl bin/update_gene_names_dunno_chrom.pl % 0

# List out the gene names that were updated:
ls gene_lists/*.txt | perl -ne 'chomp; print `sdiff -bBWs $_ $_\_hugoified`'

# If we look at the BED files, we can figure it out.

# Replace the original gene lists with the HUGO-ified gene lists:
